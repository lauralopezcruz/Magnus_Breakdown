  The Magnus breakdown is an algorithm in combinatorial group theory developed by Wilhelm Magnus in 1930. In proving an important theorem about one-relator groups, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiheitssatz">Freiheitssatz</a>, he showed that one-relator groups can be inductively broken down into amalgamated products and HNN extensions of groups with shorter relations. This inductive process is now called the Magnus breakdown. We refer any interested readers to Lyndon and Schupp&rsquo;s <i>Combinatorial Group Theory</i>, Chapter II, Section 6, which uses the Magnus breakdown to prove the Freiheitssatz.

  To help fellow group theorists with specific one-relator groups they&rsquo;re interested in, we (Laura L&oacute;pez Cruz and Christopher Natoli) coded up the Magnus breakdown and made it publicly available as this web app. It is also available on <a href="https://github.com/lauralopezcruz/Magnus_Breakdown">GitHub</a>.
